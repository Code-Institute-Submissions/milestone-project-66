# Milestone Project 1 - User-Centric Front End Development

# Elixr | Bodycentric Healing

I have decided to use this project as an opportunity to explore my research into the vast subject of alternative health and wellbeing and to present the ideas, practices and 
findings as information to the user.

The site will eventually include tailored health programs, exclusive guides
and a unique member area for registered users/clients.

The business objective of this website is based on free information and practices for the client.
However, to monetise the site and run a business from it, the members' area will be accessed
by a paid subscription, it will also feature video courses and affiliate links to
products that are relevant to the info product information.

## UX

As the subject of the project is my research into alternative health practices, the 
primary demographic of users will be people interested in learning more about such practices,
and to learn and experiment safely for themselves. As this information is relevant to a very
wide demographic (anybody with a body, interested in health) the UX had to remain simplistic,
yet informative and to include easy to follow links to pages.

I have identified three main potential users of the site:

### User Stories

#### Potential Clients

As a potential client, I would like to be able to clearly understand complex topics and 
so that I can sign up for and be confident of the information I will receive.

#### Potential Academic Peers

As a potential academic peer, I would like to be able to learn more about research developments
so I can contribute to further research, blog, and forum.

#### Casual User

As a casual user, I would like to be able to navigate each page easily, 
so that I can enjoy the content without worrying about getting lost.

High-resolution wireframes can be found [here](wireframes/milestone-project-1_elixr.pdf).

## Testing

Throughout the project, I tested functionality and fixed bugs using Google Chrome's developer tools to check CSS
and also to make the website as responsive as possible. I used Bootstrap 4's grid layout system to achieve the
basic layout for the site which made mobile-first development a bit easier. However certain elements were tricky to
get right for mobile responsiveness under 576px and media queries were used to quickly solve this.<br><br>
As I was using a lot of Bootstrap's elements and classes, I frequently referenced Bootstrap's source CSS code on GitHub
to build my CSS based on that.

### Testing Scenarios

1. Home page - philosophy section
    * Scroll to the bottom of page/click on the "Philosophy" nav button on the header.
    * From other pages, click on the "Philosophy" nav button on the header.
    * Use the "Back to Top" button in the footer to return to the top of the page.

2. Sign up/Sign in
    * Click on Sign up/Sign in button in the right of the header to access the signup modal.
    * Click on Sign up/Sign in button in home page jumbotron to access signup modal.
    * For smaller screen sizes, button in header is not displayed, however, it is still available in the main jumbotron.

3. Access information page(bodycentric-health.html)
    * Page can be accessed via the dropdown menu in navbar, "About" will take the user to the top of the page,
    and any other options will be linked to the relevant sections within the page.
    * Use the "Back to Top" button in the footer to return to the top of the page.

4. Contact form 
    * Click on the "Contact" link in the navbar to be taken to the contact page.
    * Form inputs and message will be required.
    * Click the "Submit" button to send the message.

5. Access social media
    * Social media pages can be accessed via the button links in the page footer.
