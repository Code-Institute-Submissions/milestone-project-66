# Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Front End Development

# Elixr | Bodycentric Healing

## Overview

I have decided to use this project as an opportunity to explore my research into the 
subject of alternative health and wellbeing and to present the ideas, practices and 
findings as information to the user.

The site will eventually include tailored health programmes, exclusive guides
and a unique members area for registered users/clients.

***

## UX

As the subject of the project is my own research into alternative health practices, the 
primary demographic of users will be people interested in learning more about such practices,
and to learn and experiment safely for themselves. 

I have identified three main potential users of the site:

### User Stories

#### Potential Clients

As a potential client, I would like to be able to clearly understand complex topics and 
so that I can sign up for and be confident of the information I will recieve.

#### Potential Academic Peers

As a potential academic peer, I would like to be able to learn more about research developments
so I can contribute to further research and to the blog and forum.

#### Casual User

As a casual user, I would like to be able to navigate each page easily, 
so that I am able to the enjoy the content without worrying getting lost.

High-resolution mockups/wireframes can be found in the 'Wireframes' folder within this project.
