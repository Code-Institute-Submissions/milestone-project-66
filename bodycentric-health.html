                                    Elixr is an online tailored health program based on the concept of bodycentric health.
                                    Bodycentric health focuses on the idea that the human body, and the body alone is more than capable
                                    by itself to heal itself from any and all disease by restoring the body back to it's naturally balanced state.
                                    The current medical system we have in place is based on "allopathic medicine", which means the main focus is 
                                    placed on the symptom rather than the cause. Here at Elixr, we believe that in order to naturally restore the body 
                                    back to it's natural state, can only be achieved through carefully supervised and controlled detoxificaton and repair
                                    through healthy eating, distilled water, and fasting. If you would like to hear any more information about what we have to offer,

                                    The first step is to stop poisoning yourself. Almost everything that you put in your mouth is toxic
                                    to some degree. Every time you put something into your body, your body has to react or respond to it, and usually,
                                    that response is detrimental to the body. Sometimes the response is seemingly beneficial. So what should we eat?
                                    While there is much debate around the befeits of different diets for different people, we can at least observe that
                                    the least damaging foods are fruit and cruciferous vegetables.

                                    Step two in this process is the removal of the toxins that are already in you. So what is distilled water?
                                    Distilled water is the clinical term used to describe pure water. The process of distilling involves the evaporation
                                    and condensation of water between a <a href="https://amzn.to/2Y4exjG" target="_blank" style="color: gold;">distiller</a>
                                    and a jug which removes all impurities from water more effectively than simply boiling or filtering.
                                    Tap water, mineral water, spring water and bottled water are all bad for us. The reason is because of its mineral content.
                                    We're told that minerals are good for us and we should have minerals in our water,
                                    but what they don't tell you is that there are two types of minerals - there are inorganic minerals and organic minerals -
                                    and we're all made up of organic minerals while the inorganic minerals in our water are made up of rock and dirt. When
                                    there is a surplus of inorganic minerals in the body, your body doesn't know what to do with them and starts to store them
                                    in places which cause us problems, such as our joints and glands (which manifests in arthritis and gallstones etc.).
                                    When you drink distilled water, it pulls in the inorganic from those deposits and washes them out of you. This, combined with fastng,
                                    is a very potent combination to quickly and safely detox the body.

                                    Up to 80% of our body's energy goes into digesting food
                                    There has been countless research conducted on the health benefits of fasting as a method of detoxifying the body.
                                    From intermittent to long term fasting, the evidence found shows that the process of not consuming anything for any length of time,
                                    encourages the body to divert its energy from the incredibly taxing process of digesting food, to detoxifying, repairing and healing itself.
                                    This, we believe, is one of the key tenets in taking back control of our health. If you are already familiar with the concept of fasting,
                                    and are interested in how to take the process to the next level, then you can subscribe to our <a href="sign-up-modal" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#sign-up-modal" style="color: gold;">premium service</a> for more information.
